# 🌐 Project Web Crawler

A Python-based web crawler designed to traverse websites, extract links and data, and optionally index or save results. Ideal for learning web crawling fundamentals or serving as a foundation for scraping & search-engine tasks.

## 🚀 Features & Highlights
Crawl starting from one or more seed URLs

Respect robots.txt and handle HTTP errors

Extract internal/external links and avoid revisiting URLs

Save crawled results or link lists to files

Use standard Python libraries or popular tools like requests and BeautifulSoup

---

## 🧪 How It Works
The crawler:

   Initializes a queue with seed URLs
   Fetches each page using HTTP requests
   Parses HTML to extract links
   Adds valid new links to the queue (avoiding duplicates)
   Optionally saves page contents or extracted links for further processing

This simple design helps avoid over-complication while covering core crawling logic

## ⚙️ Getting Started
  
  1. Install Dependencies
      pip install -r requirements.txt
  2. Run the Crawler
      python crawler.py \
        --seed https://example.com \
        --max-pages 100 \
        --output output/links.txt
     
#### Common Flags:
  --seed: One or more starting URLs (comma-separated)
  --max-pages: Max pages to crawl (default: 50)
  --output: File or folder for storing results

---

## 📦 Dependencies
requests — for HTTP requests

beautifulsoup4 — for HTML parsing
(Alternatively, Scrapy can be used for advanced crawling) 

---

## 🛠️ Extending the Crawler
Consider adding these enhancements:
  1. Politeness: delays, user-agent headers, proxy support

  2. Content extraction: saving page text, images, or metadata

  3. Distributed crawling: via multithreading or frameworks like Scrapy

  4. Indexing: use SQLite, Elasticsearch or IR libraries

---

## 📝 Notes
Designed for learning; adhere to crawler-friendly practices (robots.txt, rate-limits)

Use responsibly, ensuring you have permission to crawl target sites

Feel free to fork and customize for your goals
